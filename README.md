Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction and prevention of CVD can significantly reduce the risk of mortality. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of CVD based on various risk factors.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from kaggle. The dataset contains 70,000 instances with 13 attributes.

Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Performance Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC)
